Required elementary Python codes and our original Python notebook **'Raw_GCN_PPG_SQA.ipynb'** are available here for the paper **"Light Weight Graph Neural Network Models for PPG Signal Quality Assessment".**
It is recommended to view each Python files to gain an enhanced understanding of the programs.

Soon once the paper is eventually published, more information will be posted.
